# Milestone 1 Progress Update

## Current Progress

As of February 10, 2026, I have made significant strides in my project titled **Volumetric Self-Transfer for Image-Based Relighting**. The primary focus has been on implementing a volumetric self-transfer system inspired by the work of Sloan et al. on Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT). Here are the key accomplishments to date:

- **Literature Review**: Completed a comprehensive review of existing literature on PRT and its applications in volumetric rendering, particularly in dynamic environments.
- **System Design**: Developed a detailed design for the volumetric self-transfer system, outlining the architecture and components necessary for implementation.
- **Initial Implementation**: Successfully implemented the core algorithms for light attenuation and self-shadowing, which are crucial for achieving realistic relighting effects.
- **Testing and Validation**: Conducted preliminary tests to validate the accuracy of the light attenuation models against expected results.

## Next Steps

Looking ahead, my focus will shift towards the following objectives:

- **Refinement of Algorithms**: Further refine the algorithms for better performance and accuracy, particularly in handling complex lighting scenarios.
- **Integration of HDR Environment Maps**: Begin integrating dynamic HDR environment maps to enhance the realism of the relighting effects.
- **Exploration of Advanced Techniques**: Investigate additional techniques such as machine learning approaches to optimize the precomputation process and improve real-time performance.

## Challenges and Questions for the Professor

As I progress, I anticipate several challenges that I would like to discuss with you:

1. **Algorithm Optimization**: What strategies do you recommend for optimizing the performance of the light attenuation algorithms?
2. **Dynamic Environment Handling**: How can I effectively manage the integration of dynamic HDR environment maps without compromising performance?
3. **Exploration of New Techniques**: Are there specific machine learning techniques you believe would be beneficial for this project?
